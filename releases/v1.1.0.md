# ðŸŽ‰ Zawali v1.1.0 - From Counting Dinars to Counting Dividends!

_"Marhaba" to the future of personal finance, ya zawali!_ ðŸ’°

## âœ¨ Major New Features

### ðŸ“Š **Portfolio Management Page**

Finally! Now you can track your investments like a proper Tunisian entrepreneur (even if you started with just your Eid money). The new Portfolio page gives you:

- **Total Portfolio Value Tracking** - See your complete investment worth at a glance, from your first dinar to your future millions (inshallah!)
- **Total Invested Monitoring** - Keep track of exactly how much you've put in (so you know when to call your parents for more "startup capital")
- **Real Returns Calculation** - Your actual gains and losses with percentage returns (the moment of truth, ya sidi!)
- **Family Contribution Tracking** - Because let's be honest, half your portfolio is probably from teta's wedding money gifts

### ðŸ“ˆ **Advanced Investment Analytics**

Your financial analysis just got more sophisticated than a Carthage merchant:

- **Asset Allocation Chart** - Visual breakdown of where your money is invested (pie charts that actually matter!)
- **Performance Chart** - Detailed performance analysis and metrics to see if you're winning or just dreaming
- **Investment Timeline** - Monthly contributions and investment flow tracking (your financial story, chapter by chapter)
- **Holdings Overview** - Current investment positions and their values (your digital treasure chest)
- **Transaction History** - Complete investment transaction tracking (every dinar accounted for, as your accountant father taught you)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced User Experience**

Because even zawalis deserve a premium experience:

- **Market Value Updates** - Keep your investments current with real market data (no more guessing if your stocks went "to the moon" or "to Sfax")
- **Improved Modal Interfaces** - Better designed popups for holdings, transactions, and asset allocation
- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Better colors and organization (prettier than a Sidi Bou Said sunset)
- **Investment Wisdom Feed** - Get entertained while you track your money journey (because financial stress needs comic relief)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

The behind-the-scenes improvements that make everything work smoother:

- **Enhanced Database Schema** - Better data organization with color coding for clearer financial tracking
- **Improved Modal System** - Redesigned popup interfaces across all investment features for better usability
- **Optimized Performance** - Faster calculations for portfolio analysis and real-time updates
- **Better Data Flow** - Streamlined how investment data moves through the app for more reliable tracking

## ðŸš€ What This Means for You, Ya Zawali

Zawali is no longer just for tracking your daily expenses (like that morning cafÃ© au lait). It's now your **complete financial command center**! Whether you're:

- **Budgeting your monthly salary** from your government job
- **Tracking investments** you made with your olive harvest money
- **Managing family contributions** to your "get rich slowly" plan
- **Planning for the future** (buying that apartment in La Marsa, eventually)

Everything is now in one place, organized better than your mother's spice cabinet.

## ðŸ’° The Bottom Line

From your daily **"3 dinars for lunch"** budget to your **"let's buy Tesla stock"** dreams - Zawali handles it all. You started as a zawali, but you're building wealth like a true Tunisian success story.
